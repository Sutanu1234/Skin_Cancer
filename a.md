### **5. Proposed Model**

The proposed model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for the classification of skin lesion images into categories such as malignant and benign. CNNs are well-suited for medical image analysis due to their ability to extract and learn hierarchical spatial features from image data, making them an ideal choice for skin cancer detection tasks.

The pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Images are resized to \(224 \times 224\) pixels and normalized to ensure consistency in input dimensions and scale.
   - Data augmentation techniques, such as rescaling and transformations, are applied to increase dataset variability and reduce overfitting.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Convolutional layers are used to extract spatial features such as edges and textures that differentiate malignant and benign lesions.

3. **Classification**:
   - The final fully connected layer uses a softmax activation function to output class probabilities.

4. **Training**:
   - The model is trained using a supervised learning approach, with labeled images divided into training and validation sets.

### **6. Architecture**

The CNN architecture is designed to effectively classify skin lesion images. It consists of the following components:

1. **Input Layer**:
   - Accepts RGB images resized to \(224 \times 224 \times 3\).

2. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - **First Convolutional Layer**: 32 filters of size \(3 \times 3\), ReLU activation, followed by \(2 \times 2\) max-pooling.
   - **Second Convolutional Layer**: 64 filters of size \(3 \times 3\), ReLU activation, followed by \(2 \times 2\) max-pooling.
   - These layers extract spatial features and reduce the feature map size while preserving key information.

3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
   - **Dense Layer 1**: 256 neurons with ReLU activation to capture high-level abstractions.
   - **Output Layer**: A dense layer with two neurons (malignant and benign) and softmax activation for classification.

4. **Regularization**:
   - Max-pooling and ReLU activation functions ensure efficient feature extraction and help mitigate overfitting.

5. **Trainable Parameters**:
   - The architecture contains approximately 148,000 parameters, striking a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.
